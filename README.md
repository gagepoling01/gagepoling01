Hey! My name's Gage, and I am a graduate of West Virginia Wesleyan College Class of 2023, with a B.S. in Computer Science (math minor). Glad you stopped by!

I'm familiar with Python and Java, and I'm currently learning HTML/CSS through the Odin Project. I'm not sure if I'll go down the Ruby on Rails or the JavaScript path yet (leaning to JavaScript due to it's popularity)
but after that, I'm hopefully planning to learn some other tech stack such as MERN.

You can reach me at my email, gagepoling01@gmail.com.
